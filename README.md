**Summary**

Our team reviewed a dataset on Happiness Project from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report-20152021). The dataset included csv files for 7 years. Our team decided to analyze data for the past 5 years, 2017-2021 with projected columns/indicators of GDP per capita, life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity and Ladder Score.

Factors that were analyzed:
**GDP**: GDP per capita is a measure of a country’s economic output that accounts for its number of people.
**Life Expectancy**: Healthy Life Expectancy is the average number of years that a newborn can expect to live in “full health” — in other words, not hampered by disabling illnesses or injuries.
**Freedom**: Freedom of choice describes an individual’s opportunity and autonomy to perform an action selected from at least two available options, unconstrained by external parties.
**Generosity**: is defined as the residual of regressing the national average of responses to the question, “Have you donated money to a charity in past months?” on GDP capita.

The rankings of national happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible experience is a 0. The question wording is  “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you." They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The report correlates the results with various life factors.

We identified the top 5 happiest countries -- Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland and Netherlands and bottom 5 unhappiest places (Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Botswana and Lesotho --   in the world.

After the data was cleaned, we analyzed the correlations between the indicators. We have found there are some relationships between Happiness and GDP, Happiness and Freedom, and Happiness and Life Expectancy. Hardly any relationship between Happiness and Generosity.
